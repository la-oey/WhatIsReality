# WhatIsReality

Can people infer the truth from false messages when they know the sender's goal and cost function for generating larger lies?

Exp1 / marble-flip-1 - Goal conditions = {overestimate, underestimate}; Cost function conditions = {uniform, linear increasing}
- error in instructions always saying "But you don't gain any points if your opponent guesses 45 or below" regardless of condition. 

Exp1_2 / marble-flip-2 - Error fixed; time is also stated to be a server issue, not the participant making a decision

Expt 2 - Lambda AI agent conditions (or how much the opponent is willing to lie and guess down by) = {0.3, 8.1, 21.9}; practice lambda is always 5
- feedback is given every 10 trials, instead of 5
- participants only play as receivers
