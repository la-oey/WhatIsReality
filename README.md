Can people infer the truth from false messages when they know the sender's goal and cost function for generating larger lies?

Exp1 -  Goal conditions = {overestimate, underestimate}; Cost function conditions = {uniform, linear increasing}

Expt 2 - Lambda AI agent conditions (or how much the opponent is willing to lie and guess down by) = {5, 10, 20}
